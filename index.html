    <h1> True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>
<p class="lead"> Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>
    <h2> Attack</h2>
  <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
 <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause serious damage on victims larger than themselves</p>   
    <h2> Eyesight</h2> 
 <p> Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.</p>
 <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes it can perceive both polarized light, and colour vision outside the normal visual spectrum </p>
